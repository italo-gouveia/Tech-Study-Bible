# Networking (DNS, Proxies, Load Balancers) - Study Track

## Objectives
- Understand core networking: DNS, TCP/HTTP, proxies, CDNs
- Learn load balancing: L4 vs L7, algorithms, health checks
- Practice troubleshooting latency, timeouts, TLS

## Study Path
1. DNS: resolution, TTL, records (A/AAAA/CNAME/TXT)
2. HTTP/TLS: handshake, certs, HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2
3. Proxies/CDN: forward/reverse proxies, caching
4. Load Balancing: round-robin, least-connections, consistent hashing
5. Reliability: health checks, timeouts, retries, backoff

## Hands-on
- Simulate DNS lookup and caching
- Reverse proxy setup (nginx) writeup
- LB strategy comparison with request traces

## Integration Points
- Notes: `notes/networking/*`
- Projects: `projects/networking-labs/*`
