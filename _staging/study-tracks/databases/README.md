# Databases (SQL/NoSQL) - Study Track

## Objectives
- Understand relational vs document/kv/columnar models
- Apply normalization, indexing, transactions, isolation levels
- Learn partitioning (sharding) and replication strategies

## Study Path
1. SQL Fundamentals: schema design, normalization, joins, indexes
2. Transactions: ACID, isolation (read committed, repeatable read, serializable)
3. NoSQL: key-value, document, columnar, time-series
4. Scaling: sharding, replication (leader/follower, quorum), consistency
5. Query Tuning: explain plans, index selection

## Hands-on
- SQL: design schema + queries + EXPLAIN
- NoSQL: design document model + access patterns
- Sharding/replication scenario writeups

## Integration Points
- Notes: `notes/databases/*`
- Projects: `projects/databases-labs/*`
