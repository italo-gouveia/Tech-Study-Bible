## 🎯 Purpose

This collection serves as a personal knowledge base for:
- **Concept Reinforcement**: Solidify understanding of key programming concepts
- **Quick Reference**: Fast lookup for important details and examples
- **Study Preparation**: Comprehensive coverage of essential topics
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Identify and fill areas needing more study

## 📚 Usage

1. **Browse by Topic**: Navigate to specific areas of interest
2. **Study by Language**: Focus on Java or Go-specific concepts
3. **Cross-Reference**: Use general topics to understand universal concepts
4. **Practice**: Use Q&A format for self-testing and review

## 🔄 Maintenance

- Questions are added based on study needs and knowledge gaps
- Answers include code examples and practical explanations
- Regular review and updates to keep content current
- Integration with practical projects for hands-on learning
