# Analysis: resources/books
- Type: resource
- Proposed path: resources/books
- Why here: Centralize study books with notes cross-linked to `notes/`
- Structure to create:
```
books/
  <title-slug>/
    README.md
    notes.md
```
- Templates used: note.md (for notes), project.md (for optional code samples)
- Open questions: which books to include first?

## Next Actions
- [ ] List initial books
- [ ] Create per-book folders with notes
- [ ] Cross-link to related notes and projects
