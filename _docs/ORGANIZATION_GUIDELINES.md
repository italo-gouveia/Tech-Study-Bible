## Problem Organization

### Naming Convention
Each problem folder should follow this pattern:
```
[PROBLEM_NUMBER].[PROBLEM_TITLE]/
```

Example: `1768.merge-strings-alternately/`

### Folder Structure for Each Problem
```
[PROBLEM_NUMBER].[PROBLEM_TITLE]/
├── README.md                   # Problem description and analysis
├── solutions/                  # All solution implementations
│   ├── java/                   # Java solutions
│   │   ├── solution1.java      # First approach
│   │   ├── solution2.java      # Optimized approach
│   │   └── README.md           # Java-specific explanations
│   ├── go/                     # Go solutions
│   │   ├── solution1.go
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── python/                 # Python solutions

└── analysis/                   # Problem analysis and complexity
    ├── approach.md             # Different approaches considered
    ├── complexity.md           # Time and space complexity analysis
    └── test-cases.md           # Test cases and edge cases

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
1. **Clean Code**: Write readable, well-commented code
2. **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
3. **Comments**: Explain complex logic and algorithms
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle all edge cases mentioned in constraints

### Performance Considerations
1. **Multiple Solutions**: Provide different approaches when applicable
2. **Optimization**: Include both brute force and optimized solutions
3. **Complexity Analysis**: Always include time and space complexity
4. **Memory Usage**: Consider memory-efficient solutions

### Documentation
1. **Line-by-Line**: Explain each line of code for learning purposes
2. **Approach Explanation**: Explain the thought process and algorithm
3. **Edge Cases**: Document how edge cases are handled
4. **Test Cases**: Include test cases and expected outputs

## Submission Guidelines

### When Adding New Solutions
1. Create the problem folder if it doesn't exist
2. Add the problem description in the main README.md
3. Implement solutions in appropriate language folders
4. Add detailed explanations for each solution
5. Include complexity analysis
6. Test all solutions with provided examples

### Code Formatting
1. Follow language-specific style guides
2. Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for most languages)
3. Include proper imports/dependencies
4. Add class/function documentation where appropriate

## Learning Objectives

### For Each Problem, Document:
1. **Problem Understanding**: What the problem is asking
2. **Approach Selection**: Why this approach was chosen
3. **Implementation Details**: How the solution works
4. **Optimization**: How to improve the solution
5. **Alternative Approaches**: Other ways to solve the problem
6. **Key Learnings**: What concepts were reinforced or learned

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
1. **New Solutions**: Add new solutions as they are discovered
2. **Optimizations**: Update solutions with better approaches
3. **Documentation**: Keep explanations current and accurate
4. **Testing**: Verify all solutions work with current test cases

### Quality Assurance
1. **Code Review**: Review solutions for correctness and efficiency
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure explanations are clear and complete
3. **Consistency Check**: Maintain consistent formatting and structure
4. **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal links work correctly
```

## Recommendations

### Study Strategy
1. **Start with Easy**: Begin with easy problems to build confidence
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for common patterns across problems
3. **Multiple Languages**: Practice the same problem in different languages
4. **Time Tracking**: Track time spent on each problem for improvement

### Problem Selection
1. **Variety**: Choose problems from different categories
2. **Progression**: Gradually increase difficulty
3. **Review**: Regularly revisit solved problems
4. **Mock Interviews**: Use problems for interview preparation

### Tools and Resources
