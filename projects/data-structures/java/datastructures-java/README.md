# Data Structures in Java

Java implementations for common data structures: arrays, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, heaps, trees, tries, graphs.

## Structure
```
src/
  <topic>/
    <implementation>/
      *.java
out/ (generated)
README.md
BUILD_AND_RUN.md
```

## Build & Run
See BUILD_AND_RUN.md for instructions to compile and run individual demos (each subfolder has a `Main.java`).

## Tests
- Add unit tests per structure (JUnit 5) under `tests/` (planned).

## Notes
- Each subfolder includes a `Readme.md` describing the implementation.
