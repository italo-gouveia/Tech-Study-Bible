# Explanation:
**Definition:** A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings where each node represents a common prefix. It is particularly useful for storing and searching for strings efficiently.

### Class Definition:
- **Trie:** The main class representing the trie data structure.

### Inner Class TrieNode:
- **children:** A map that stores child nodes, where each key is a character and the value is another TrieNode.
- **isEndOfWord:** A boolean flag indicating whether the current node represents the end of a word.

### Constructor:
- Initializes the root node of the trie.

### Insert Method:
- **insert(String word):** Inserts a word into the trie. It traverses through each character of the word and creates new nodes as needed. It marks the end of the word with isEndOfWord.

### Search Method:
- **search(String word):** Checks if a word is present in the trie. It traverses through each character of the word and returns true if it finds the word and isEndOfWord is true.

### StartsWith Method:
- **startsWith(String prefix):** Checks if there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix. It traverses through the prefix and returns true if the prefix is found.

# When to Use:
- **Autocomplete:** When implementing features like autocomplete or suggestions where you need to quickly find words with a given prefix. 
- **Autocomplete:** features in text editors and search engines.
- **Spell Checking:** For dictionary-based spell-checking and correction. 
- **Dictionary implementations:** where searching for words with common prefixes is frequent.
- **Efficient Prefix Queries:** When you need to perform many prefix-based queries efficiently.

# When Not to Use:
- Memory Constraints: Tries can use significant memory, especially for large datasets with many keys. If memory is a concern, other data structures like hash tables might be more appropriate.
- Single String Lookups: For simple scenarios with a single key or value lookups, a trie might be overkill compared to simpler structures like hash tables or arrays.
