# Explanation:

### Node Class:

Represents each element (node) in the linked list.
Contains data to store the value of the node and next to reference the next node in the list.

### LinkedList Class:

Manages the linked list operations (insertAtBeginning, insertAtEnd, deleteNode, displayList).
head points to the first node of the linked list.

#### insertAtBeginning(int data):

Creates a new node with the given data.
Sets the new node's next to the current head.
Updates head to point to the new node, making it the new head.

#### insertAtEnd(int data):

Creates a new node with the given data.
If the list is empty (head == null), sets head to the new node.
Otherwise, traverses the list to find the last node (current.next == null).
Sets the next of the last node to the new node.

#### deleteNode(int data):

Handles deletion of a node with the specified data.
Special cases include deleting the head node or if the node to be deleted is not found.
Traverses the list to find the node with data.
Adjusts next references to skip over the node to be deleted.

#### displayList():

Traverses the linked list starting from head.
Prints the data of each node sequentially.

### Main Class:

Creates an instance of LinkedList.
Tests various operations such as insertion at the beginning and end, deletion, and display.

## Key Points:

* **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
* **Node Management:** Insertion and deletion operations involve adjusting next references.
* **Traversal:** Displaying or manipulating the list requires traversing from head to null.

This implementation provides basic functionality for a singly linked list in Java, demonstrating fundamental operations like insertion, deletion, and display.






## When to use?
Linked lists are suitable for various scenarios where dynamic data structures are required and when certain operations like insertion and deletion need to be efficient. Here are some specific situations where linked lists are commonly used:

### 1. Dynamic Size: 
* Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size as needed since each node only requires memory allocation when created.

### 2. Insertions and Deletions: 

* Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list can be done in constant time

O(1) if the position is known. This makes linked lists efficient for scenarios where frequent modifications are required, especially at the beginning or middle of the list.

### 3. No Pre-allocation: 

* Unlike arrays where memory allocation needs to be done upfront and is typically fixed, linked lists allocate memory for each element dynamically. This flexibility can be advantageous in scenarios where the size of the data structure is unpredictable or changes frequently.

### 4. Implementation of Stacks and Queues: 

* Linked lists are commonly used to implement dynamic data structures like stacks and queues, where elements are added or removed from one end (top for stacks, rear for queues).

### 5. Memory Management: 

* Linked lists can handle situations where memory is fragmented or limited, as they only require contiguous memory for each node, not necessarily in a single block.

### 6. Sequential Access Not Required: 

* While arrays offer

O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index, linked lists do not provide direct indexing. However, they are still useful when sequential access is not a primary requirement or when the overhead of maintaining index references in arrays is not justified.

### 7. Alternative to Arrays: 

* In situations where arrays would require frequent resizing (which can be costly), linked lists can provide a more efficient alternative due to their dynamic nature.


## When not to use linked lists?

### 1. Random Access: 

* If frequent random access to elements by index is required, arrays (or other data structures like ArrayList in Java) are generally more efficient. Linked lists do not support

O(1) time complexity for random access, as accessing an element requires traversing the list from the beginning or a known reference point.

### 2. Memory Overhead: 

* Each node in a linked list requires additional memory for storing the reference to the next node, which can result in higher memory overhead compared to arrays, especially for small data sets or when memory efficiency is critical.

### 3. Cache Locality: 

* Linked lists may not utilize memory caching as efficiently as arrays do, due to their non-contiguous storage and potentially scattered memory locations.

In summary, linked lists are particularly useful when flexibility in size, efficient insertions/deletions, and dynamic memory allocation are important considerations. They are widely used in scenarios where these characteristics outweigh the drawbacks related to direct indexing and memory overhead.
