# Explanation:

### Class Definition:
- **MyLinkedHashSet<E>:** A generic class representing a linked hash set where E is the type of elements stored.

### Data Structure:
- **LinkedList<E>[] table**: An array of linked lists where each list represents a bucket for storing elements.

### Inner Class:
- **Node<E>:** Represents a node in the linked list, holding an element and a reference to the next node. This is used to maintain the order of elements.

### Constructor:
- Initializes the hash table with INITIAL_CAPACITY (16 buckets) and creates a linked list for each bucket.

### Hash Function:
- **hash(E element):** Computes the index for an element based on its hash code, ensuring a non-negative index.

### Adding Elements:
- **add(E element):** Adds an element to the set if it is not already present. Uses the hash function to find the appropriate bucket.

### Removing Elements:
- **remove(E element):** Removes the specified element from the set if it exists.

### Checking Presence:
- **contains(E element):** Checks if an element is in the set by looking in the appropriate bucket.

### Size and Empty Check:
- **size():** Returns the number of elements in the set.
- **isEmpty():** Checks if the set is empty.

# When to Use:
- **Maintaining Order:** When you need to maintain the order of insertion of elements.
- **Unique Elements:** When you need a collection of unique elements and want to avoid duplicates.
- **Fast Lookups:** When you need efficient lookups, additions, and deletions with order preservation.

# When Not to Use:
- **Sorted Data:** If you need a sorted set, consider using TreeSet instead.
- **Memory Constraints:** If memory is a concern, this implementationâ€™s overhead might be a drawback due to the hash table and linked list structure.
