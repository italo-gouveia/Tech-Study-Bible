# Class Definition:

MySet<E>: A generic class representing a set where E is the type of elements stored.

### Data Structure:
**LinkedList<E>[] table:** An array of linked lists, each list represents a bucket in the hash table.

### Constructor:
Initializes the table with INITIAL_CAPACITY (16 buckets) and creates a linked list for each bucket.

### Hash Function:
**hash(E element):** Computes the index for the element based on its hash code. Ensures non-negative index using Math.abs.

### Adding Elements:
**add(E element):** Adds an element to the set if it is not already present. Uses the hash function to find the appropriate bucket.

### Removing Elements:
**remove(E element):** Removes the element from the set if it exists. Adjusts the size of the set accordingly.

### Checking Presence:
**contains(E element):** Checks if an element is in the set by looking in the appropriate bucket.

### Size and Empty Check:
**size():** Returns the number of elements in the set.
**isEmpty():** Checks if the set has no elements.

# When to Use:
- **Unique Elements:** When you need a collection of unique elements and want to avoid duplicates.
- **Fast Lookups:** When you need quick lookups, additions, and deletions (average O(1) time complexity for these operations).
- **Unordered Data:** When the order of elements does not matter.

# When Not to Use:
- **Order Matters:** If you need to maintain the order of elements, consider using a LinkedHashSet instead.
- **Sorted Data:** If you need a sorted set, use TreeSet, which maintains elements in a sorted order.
- **Memory Constraints:** If memory is a concern, the overhead of maintaining a hash table and linked lists might be a drawback.

- This implementation is a simplified version and doesn’t include advanced features like resizing the table when it becomes full or handling collisions in a more sophisticated manner. In real-world scenarios, you would use the Java Collections Framework’s HashSet, which is optimized and handles these details efficiently.
