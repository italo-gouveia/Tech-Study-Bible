## Explanation

### Creation
- **AVL Tree** is created by defining a `Node` class that holds the key, height, and pointers to left and right children. The `AVLTree` class manages the root node and provides methods for insertion and traversal.

### Insertion
- When inserting elements using the `insert()` method, the tree performs a standard binary search tree (BST) insert. After insertion, the tree checks and maintains the AVL Tree balance using rotations.

### Rotations
- **Right Rotation** (`rightRotate()`): Balances the tree when the left subtree is heavier.
- **Left Rotation** (`leftRotate()`): Balances the tree when the right subtree is heavier.
- **Left-Right and Right-Left Cases**: Handle imbalances where a single rotation is insufficient, requiring a combination of rotations.

### Printing
- The `inorder()` method performs an in-order traversal of the tree to display elements in ascending order.

## When to Use AVL Tree

- **Balanced Tree:** When you need a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains O(log n) time complexity for operations.
- **Frequent Insertions and Deletions:** Useful when you need to keep the tree balanced with frequent modifications.

## When Not to Use AVL Tree

- **Simple Searches:** For simple lookups where self-balancing is not required, simpler BSTs may suffice.
- **Memory Constraints:** AVL Trees consume more memory due to storing height information.
- **Complex Operations:** If the overhead of rotations outweighs the benefits, consider other data structures.

## Summary

- **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures O(log n) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups by maintaining balance through rotations.
- It is particularly useful when frequent modifications are required while maintaining sorted order.
