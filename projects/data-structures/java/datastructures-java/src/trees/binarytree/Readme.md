# Binary Tree
   Definition: A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Types:

Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with the property that for each node, the left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Balanced Binary Search Tree: Variants like AVL trees and Red-Black trees that ensure the tree remains balanced (i.e., height is logarithmic) to maintain efficient operations (search, insert, delete in O(log n) time).

Applications:

Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations (BST).
Sorting elements (BST with inorder traversal gives sorted order).
Symbol tables and database indexing.
