## Explanation

### Creation
- **TreeSet** is created using the `new TreeSet<>()` constructor. It maintains its elements in sorted order.

### Adding Elements
- When adding elements with `add()`, duplicates are ignored, and elements are inserted into the Red-Black Tree structure.

### Printing
- The `TreeSet` automatically sorts the elements. Printing the `TreeSet` displays them in ascending order.

### Checking Containment
- The `contains()` method checks if a specific element is present in the `TreeSet`.

### Navigating
- The `first()` and `last()` methods provide the smallest and largest elements in the `TreeSet`, respectively.

### Removing Elements
- The `remove()` method deletes an element from the `TreeSet`.

## When to Use TreeSet

- **Sorted Data:** Use `TreeSet` when you need a set that maintains its elements in a sorted order.
- **Navigable Set Operations:** Useful when you need efficient operations to find the smallest, largest, or any element in a sorted order.
- **Range Queries:** Ideal for operations that involve range queries, such as finding elements within a certain range.

## When Not to Use TreeSet

- **Unsorted Data Requirements:** If you don't need the elements to be sorted and just need a set with no duplicates, consider using `HashSet` for faster performance.
- **Performance Concerns:** For applications where performance is critical and sorting adds unnecessary overhead, `HashSet` or `LinkedHashSet` might be more appropriate.
- **Memory Constraints:** `TreeSet` can use more memory compared to simpler data structures due to the need to maintain the tree structure and balance.

## Summary

- **TreeSet** is a Java class that provides a navigable set with elements sorted in their natural order or by a specified comparator.
- Internally, `TreeSet` uses a Red-Black Tree to maintain the order of elements and ensure O(log n) time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.

In summary, Javaâ€™s `TreeSet` provides a high-level abstraction that leverages the Red-Black Tree data structure for sorted set operations, offering a blend of performance and functionality for ordered data management.
