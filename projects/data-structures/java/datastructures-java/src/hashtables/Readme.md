# Explanation:

### Class Definition:
- **MyHashTable<K, V>:** A generic class representing a hash table where K is the type of keys and V is the type of values.

### Data Structure:
- **LinkedList<Entry<K, V>>[] table:** An array of linked lists where each list holds entries with key-value pairs.

### Inner Class:
- **Entry<K, V>:** Represents a key-value pair.

### Constructor:
- Initializes the hash table with **INITIAL_CAPACITY** (16 buckets) and creates a linked list for each bucket.

### Hash Function:
- **hash(K key):** Computes the index for a key based on its hash code, ensuring a non-negative index.

### Putting Entries:
- **put(K key, V value):** Adds a key-value pair to the table. If the key already exists, its value is updated.

### Getting Entries:
- **get(K key):** Retrieves the value associated with a key. Returns null if the key is not found.

### Removing Entries:
- **remove(K key):** Removes the entry with the specified key from the table.

### Size and Empty Check:
- **size():** Returns the number of entries in the hash table.
- **isEmpty():** Checks if the hash table has no entries.

# When to Use:
- **Fast Lookups:** When you need fast access to key-value pairs. Average time complexity for put, get, and remove operations is O(1).
- **Unordered Data:** When the order of elements does not matter.

# When Not to Use:
- **Sorted Data:** If you need the elements to be stored in a specific order, consider using a TreeMap instead.
- **Memory Constraints:** If memory is a concern, a hash table with many collisions may lead to inefficient use of space.
