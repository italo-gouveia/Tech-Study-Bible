# Design Patterns in Java

Java examples for creational, structural, behavioral patterns, plus others (command, iterator, composite, etc.).

## Structure
```
src/
  creational/
  structural/
  behavioral/
  others/
out/ (generated)
README.md
BUILD_AND_RUN.md
```

## Build & Run
See BUILD_AND_RUN.md for instructions to compile and run each pattern demo (each subfolder typically includes a `Main.java`).

## Tests
- Add JUnit tests per pattern (planned).

## Notes
- Each pattern folder contains a `Readme.md` with intent and participants.
