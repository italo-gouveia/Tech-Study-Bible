# Explanation:

### Singleton Pattern:

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it, useful for global state or resource management.

### Factory Method Pattern: 

Defines an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate, useful when you have multiple implementations of a product interface.

### Abstract Factory Pattern: 

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes, useful when you need to create related objects that work together.

# When to Use Creational Patterns:

### Singleton: 

Use when you need to ensure a single instance of a class throughout the application, such as logging, configuration settings, or managing resources.

### Factory Method: 

Use when you have a family of related products or when the creation of objects involves complex logic that should be hidden from the client code.

### Abstract Factory: 

Use when you need to create families of related or dependent objects and want to ensure compatibility among products created.

# When Not to Use Creational Patterns:

### Singleton: 

Avoid when you need multiple instances of a class or when overusing global state can lead to maintainability issues.

### Factory Method: 

Avoid when the client code needs to make decisions about which concrete class to instantiate, or when there's no need for polymorphic creation.

### Abstract Factory: 

Avoid when you have only one product family or when adding new products to the family frequently, as it can lead to bloated interfaces.

Each creational pattern serves specific needs and helps in managing object creation effectively in different scenarios. Understanding their strengths and limitations will guide you in choosing the appropriate pattern for your design requirements.
