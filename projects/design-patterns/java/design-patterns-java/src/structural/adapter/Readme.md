# Explanation: 

The Adapter pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper with a compatible interface. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

**MediaPlayer:** 
Defines the target interface that clients use to interact with different types of media players.

**VLCPlayer:** 
Represents the existing class with an incompatible interface that we want to adapt.

**VLCPlayerAdapter:** 
Implements the MediaPlayer interface by wrapping the VLCPlayer and providing a method to play VLC files.

**AdapterPatternDemo:** 
Demonstrates how the adapter (VLCPlayerAdapter) is used to play a VLC file through the MediaPlayer interface.

# When to Use:

Use when you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match the one you need.
Use when you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.

# When Not to Use:

Do not use when you can modify the source class to implement the desired interface directly.
Do not use when you are creating an adapter just to make two classes work together for a specific case without future use.
