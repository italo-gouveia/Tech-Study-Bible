# Guidelines for Choosing Structural Patterns:

* ### Understand the Problem Context: 

Choose a pattern that fits the problem's structure and requirements.

* ### Consider Flexibility: 

Structural patterns should enhance flexibility and maintainability, not complicate the design.

* ### Avoid Over-Engineering: 

Do not introduce patterns unnecessarily; use them where they genuinely simplify the design.

* ### Future Use: 

Use patterns that allow for future changes and extensions without significant modification.
