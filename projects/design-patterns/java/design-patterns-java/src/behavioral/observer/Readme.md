# Explanation:

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## When to Use:

* Use the Observer pattern when you have a one-to-many relationship between objects, and when changes to one object require notifying other objects.
* Use when the number of objects that need to be informed about state changes is unknown or changes dynamically.

## When Not to Use:

* Avoid using the Observer pattern if the system has unrelated objects that should not be tightly coupled with the subject.
* Avoid when the overhead of maintaining references to dependent objects outweighs the benefits of loose coupling.

# Guidelines for Behavioral Patterns:
* **Choose Based on Interaction Requirements:** Select patterns that best fit the communication and interaction needs between objects in your system.
* **Consider Flexibility:** Behavioral patterns should enhance the flexibility and maintainability of your code, especially in scenarios where behavior may vary.
* **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Use patterns judiciously to avoid unnecessary complexity, especially when simpler alternatives can achieve the same goals effectively.

By applying these patterns appropriately, you can improve the design, flexibility, and maintainability of your Java applications, ensuring they meet evolving requirements effectively.
