# Explanation
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## **When to Use:**

* Use the Strategy pattern when you want to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
* Use when you have multiple variants of an algorithm and want to avoid using conditional statements in client code.

## **When Not to Use:**

* Avoid using the Strategy pattern if the algorithm changes infrequently or if there are only minor variations between algorithms. In such cases, simpler approaches like using a single method with conditional statements might be more appropriate.
