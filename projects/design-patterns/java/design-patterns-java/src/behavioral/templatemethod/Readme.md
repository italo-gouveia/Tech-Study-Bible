# Explanation:

The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

# Key Participants in Template Method Pattern:
* **Abstract Class:** Defines the template method that outlines the algorithm's structure. It may also include concrete methods and abstract methods that subclasses must implement.

* **Concrete Class:** Implements the abstract methods defined in the abstract class. It provides specific implementations for the abstract methods, thereby customizing the behavior defined in the template method.

# **When to Use the Template Method Pattern:**

* **To define the skeleton of an algorithm:** Use the Template Method pattern when you have an algorithm that has a fixed structure but certain steps can be implemented differently by subclasses.

* **To avoid code duplication:** Use when there are common steps in multiple algorithms that can be abstracted into a template method.

* **To control the overall algorithm:** Use when you want to define the overall structure of an algorithm while allowing flexibility in certain steps.

# **When Not to Use the Template Method Pattern:**
* **When algorithms vary significantly:** If the steps of algorithms vary drastically, and there's little commonality in their structure, the Template Method pattern may introduce unnecessary complexity.

* **When flexibility is not needed:** If the algorithm's structure is unlikely to change or if the variations between implementations are minimal, a simpler approach might be more appropriate.

# **Summary:**

The Template Method pattern is valuable when you need to define the outline of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps. It promotes code reuse, reduces duplication, and provides a structured way to define and manage algorithmic workflows in Java applications.
