## Composite Design Pattern in Java

### Explanation

1. **Component Interface**: Defines a common interface for both leaf and composite objects. This allows for uniform treatment of individual objects and composites.

2. **Leaf Class**: Implements the `Component` interface and represents the end objects in the hierarchy that do not have children. It performs its own operation.

3. **Composite Class**: Implements the `Component` interface and contains a collection of child `Component` objects. It delegates the operation to its children, allowing you to treat both leaf and composite objects uniformly.

4. **Client**: Creates leaf and composite objects, builds the hierarchy, and calls operations on the composite objects.

### How to Use

- **Use the Composite Pattern** when you need to represent part-whole hierarchies, where individual objects and compositions of objects should be treated uniformly.
- **Apply this pattern** when you need to manage complex tree structures with a consistent way to perform operations on both individual objects and compositions.

### How Not to Use

- **Do not use** the Composite Pattern if you don’t need to manage hierarchies or if the structure is flat and doesn’t require recursive operations.
- **Avoid excessive use** of this pattern if it introduces unnecessary complexity or if the hierarchy is simple enough that a straightforward approach would be more appropriate.
